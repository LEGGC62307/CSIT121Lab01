            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I shipped out for recruit training at Parris Island on February 14, 2005, and honorably served for 13 years in the United States Marine Corps.  When I mention my service
             timeframe I am usually asked why I got out, seeing as how I only needed 7 more years until I could retire.  Most that have served understand that there is a time in your
             career when you know it is time to go.  For me it was primarily centered around the impact my service was having on my family, especially my son.  The analogy I have used 
             when asked by other service members, is "one can only crack the foundation so much before it crumbles".  Fortunately, my last duty station was at a national agency
             and I was able to briefly continue my government service as a civil servant, leading to a deferred retirement with 18 years of combined government service.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
             
                Currently I am working to obtain an Associates of Applied Science degree in the Information Technology field at CCBC.  After completing a few years of college prior to my 18 years of 
             government service I learned that my existing credits accounted for over 50 percent of the degree.  But I am actually working towards 2 separate career fields with 2 separate
             goals in mind, under 1 priority. The first is to complete what I started 24 years ago by obtaining a degree in the IT field, and the second which is proving much more difficult, 
             is to become a professional pilot.  I respectfully view both as bucket list items in my life, and both are as equally important as the other.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                For the first 5 years in the Marine Corps, my military occupational specialty was an engine (F404-GE-400 & 402) and fuel systems mechanic on the FA-18 Legacy Hornet.  
             In addition to my mechanical skills, I was also a certified Plane Captain with experience running flight operation on land.  As for hobbies, first and foremost I am 
             a full-time father to a teenage son. But when I have time, I enjoy hiking as a form of physical fitness as well as building wooden models.
